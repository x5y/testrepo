Introduction
============

Welcome to the readme Confluence-Survey-Plugin Page.

Usage
=====

Since Version 1.2.9 the Macro Browser is quite comfortably described to use, but you are welcome to still read
the following usage but its for the old plugin version 1 system and is mainly copied from the shipped help (within the plugin)

Survey-Macro
------------

<table>
<tr bgcolor=ffffff>
  <td>
    {survey:changeableVotes=true|voters=user1,user2|viewers=user3}<br />
    Knowledge - This is the knowledge category.<br />
    Communication - This is the communication category.<br />
    {survey}<br />
  </td>

  <td>
    <p>
      The survey macro allows Confluence users to be surveyed on several categories.
      For each category, users are allowed to select only one of the given choices,
      and the results will not be visible to them until they have voted. Users
      that have not logged in will be prompted to do so before allowing them to
      cast a vote. This macro was created to support surveys of confluence users
      on several categories and will provide them with the chance to give a
      rating (1 to 5) for each category as well as a comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body of this macro defines the categories that the users will be polled
      on. Each line of the body will be treated as a seperate category and
      should be written in the format "title - description". The title is
      always required but the dash and the description are optional.
    </p>

Vote-Macro
==========

  <td>
    <p>
      The vote macro allows Confluence users to vote on any topic of interest.
      Users are allowed to select only one of the given choices and vote one time,
      and the results will not be visible to them until they have voted. Users
      that have not logged in will be prompted to do so before allowing them to
      cast a vote. This macro was created to support quick, informal votes on
      various topics. The macro has a title and a series of choices, each choice
      starting on its own line.

History
=======

The Plugin originated in 2006 and was taken over for maintenance in 2008, that time it was quite unsupported.

I maintained it until i had no personel access to a confluence installation anymore (2011).

As in 2012 the JIRA Studio at Atlassian closed its doors i had to find another location. Welcome GitHub ;)
In June 2013 i had quite some inquiries to carry on, so i am currently evaluating some things (compatibility, documentation, maybe features).

Main focus is maintenance, test coverage and getting the thing somehow usable with the macro browser.

If someone feels to help out, feel free to contact me.
